Baobab Touchscreen Toolkit
---------------------------

The Touchscreen Toolkit is a library for transforming HTML pages into touch-friendly user interfaces. This is a combination of JavaScript and CSS. It transforms standard HTML forms as they are loaded in a browser, into a set of wizard-like pages displaying  each of the input fields on separate screens. For each input field, the Touchscreen Toolkit displays a customized page with:

* Appropriate input controls
* User instructions
* Global navigation buttons (Next, Back, Cancel and Finish)
* Data validation criteria (optional)

A Touchscreen Toolkit page can be 'skipped' depending on whether an optionally specified condition for each of the fields is met or not.

Getting Started
---------------

It is pretty simple to use Touchscreen Toolkit. Just add touchscreen.js and any of the touchscreen css files in stylesheet directory into your HTML application. For HTML forms, make sure that your HTML is standard to avoid conflicts. See examples for details.

History
-------

The original touchscreen toolkit was developed by Baobab Health Partnership (now [Baobab Health Trust](http://www.baobabhealth.org)) in 2006. The toolkit passed through some revolutions within the organization. There were once more than one version of the toolkit within the organization. Developers were maintaining their own versions of the toolkit as it became an orphan project. In 2011, we forked it from [Baobab](https://github.com/baobab)'s Github repository to here, the organization's repository and started standardizing it. Since then, it is maintained here.
