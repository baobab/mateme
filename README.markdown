Outpatient is a simple patient registration application written in Ruby on Rails
and is intended as a web front end for OpenMRS. 

OpenMRSÂ® is a community-developed, open-source, enterprise electronic medical 
record system framework. We've come together to specifically respond to those 
actively building and managing health systems in the developing world, where 
AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria afflict the lives of millions. Our mission is 
to foster self-sustaining health information technology implementations in 
these environments through peer mentorship, proactive collaboration, and a code 
base that equals or surpasses proprietary equivalents. You are welcome to come 
participate in the community, whether by implementing our software, or 
contributing your efforts to our mission!

Outpatient was built by Baobab Health and Partners in Health in
